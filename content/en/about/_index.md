Nice to meet you. I am Yongtae Kim, a developer researching the brain.

I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree at KAIST in the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering and the School of Computing. I am also a research intern in Professor Ah-In Jung's lab. My research focuses on the concept of cognitive flexibility, a key topic in cognitive neuroscience, utilizing approaches from neuroscience and software engineering. Recently, I have been using training with an operant conditioning chamber as one of the methods in this research.

I have built my career as a software engineer in South Korean startups. Until 2023, I worked as a backend engineer at Ably Corporation, the largest womenâ€™s fashion platform in Korea, developing features related to delivery and user convenience. Before that, I worked at UniqueGood Company, which operates the interactive content platform Real World, where I developed and improved backend functionalities necessary for the platform's operation.

For more details, please feel free to check my CV.
